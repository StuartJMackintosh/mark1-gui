# Mark 1 Gui
This will be a ongoing project in flask to build a web ui for the mark 1.

Currently setup for http://mark1_ip:8080 will take you to the login page

# Login Example:

The username and pw for the login is taken from the config.json file.  After logging in you will see something similiar to this image, after I finish getting all the data in here that is needed then a CSS can clean it up and make it look pretty:
